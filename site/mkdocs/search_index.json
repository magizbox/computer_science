The formal definition of database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of the database language. The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, the database schema. This describes how real world entities are modeled in the database.\n\n\n1.1.1 Type\n\n\nIn computer science and computer programming, a data type or simply type is a classification identifying one of various types of data, such as real, integer or Boolean, that determines the possible values for that type; the operations that can be done on values of that type; the meaning of the data; and the way values of that type can be stored.\n\n\nTEXT\n, \nINT\n, \nENUM\n, \nTIMESTAMP\n\n\n1.2 Cardinality (a.k.a Relationship)\n\n\nForeign key\n, \nPrimary key\n\n\n1.2 Indexing\n\n\nA database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records. Why Indexing is important?\n\n\nIndexing in MySQL\n\n\nCREATE INDEX NameIndex ON Employee (name)\nSELECT * FROM Employee WHERE name = 'Ashish'\n\n\n\n\n2. Data Manipulation\n\n\nCreate - Read - Update - Delete\n\n\n\n\nCreate or add new entries\n\n\nRead, retrieve, search, or view existing entries * Update or edit existing entries * Delete/deactivate existing entries\n\n\n\n\n/* create */\nCREATE TABLE Guests ( id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, firstname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, lastname VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(50), reg_date TIMESTAMP )\n/* create (insert) */\nINSERT INTO Guests (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john@example.com')\n/* read */\nSELECT * FROM Guests WHERE id=1 /* update */ UPDATE Guests SET lastname='Doe' WHERE id=1\n/* delete */\nDELETE FROM Guests WHERE id=1`\n\n\n\n\n3.

A transaction generally represents any change in database. Example: Transfer 900$ from Account\n\n\nBob\n to \nAlice\n\n\nstart transaction\nselect balance from Account where Account_Number='Bob';\nselect balance from Account where Account_Number='Alice';\nupdate Account set balance=balance-900 here Account_Number='Bob' ;\nupdate Account set balance=balance+900 here Account_Number='Alice' ;\ncommit; //if all sql queries succed rollback; //if any of Sql queries failed or error\n\n\n\n\nACID Properties\n\n\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction.\n\n\nFor example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction. ![][16]\n\n\n4. Backup and Restore\n\n\nSometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When this state is needed, i.e., when it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are utilized to restore that state.\n\n\n5. Migration\n\n\nIn software engineering, schema migration (also database migration, database change management) refers to the management of incremental, reversible changes to relational database schemas. A schema migration is performed on a database whenever it is necessary to update or revert that database's schema to some newer or older version. Example: Android Migration by droid-migrate\n\n\ndroid-migrate init -d my_database droid-migrate generate up droid-migrate generate down\n\n\n\n\nExample: Database Seeding with Laravel\n\n\n6. Active record pattern | Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)\n\n\nObject-relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a \"virtual object database\" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to create their own ORM tools.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nphp\n\n\n$employee = new Employee(); $employee-\nsetName(\nJoe\n); $employee-\nsave();\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\npublic class User {\n  @DatabaseField(id = true) String username;\n  @DatabaseField String password;\n  @DatabaseField String email;\n  @DatabaseField String alias;\n  public User() {} }\n\n\n\n\nImplementations\n\n\n\n\nAndroid: [ormlite-android]\n\n\nPHP: [Eloquent]",

You can see that there are two such virtual machines with IP addresses of 172.16.1.2 and 172.16.1.3.  When you configure a virtual machine as using NAT, it doesn\u2019t see the production network directly.  In fact, all traffic coming from the virtual machine will share the VM host\u2019s IP address.

It is a plain text file. Originally a file named HOSTS.TXT was manually maintained and made available via file sharing by Stanford Research Institute for the ARPANET membership, containing the hostnames and address of hosts as contributed for inclusion by member organizations\n\n\nFile content\n\n\nThe hosts file contains lines of text consisting of an IP address in the first text field followed by one or more host names. Each field is separated by white space \u2013 tabs are often preferred for historical reasons, but spaces are also used. Comment lines may be included; they are indicated by a hash character (#) in the first position of such lines. Entirely blank lines in the file are ignored. For example, a typical hosts file may contain the following:\n\n\n127.0.0.1  localhost loopback\n::1        localhost\n\n\n\n\nLocation in the file system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating System\n\n\nVersions\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnix, Unix-like, POSIX\n\n\n\n\n/etc/hosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Windows\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n%WinDir%\\HOSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n95, 98, ME\n\n\n%WinDir%\\hosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNT, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista\n\n\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008, 7, 2012, 8, 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple Macintosh\n\n\n9 and earlier\n\n\nPreferences or System folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac OS X 10.0\u201310.1.5\n\n\n(Added through NetInfo or niload)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac OS X 10.2 and newer\n\n\n/etc/hosts (a symbolic link to /private/etc/hosts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nComplete Linux Networking Tutorial\n\n\nLinux Networking Tutorial for System Admins w/Subtitles\n\n\nLinux Networking Basics\n\n\nPacket Analyzer: 15 TCPDUMP Command Examples",
